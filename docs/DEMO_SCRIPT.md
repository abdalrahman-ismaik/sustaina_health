## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition Flow:
1. **Permission Check** → Request microphone access
2. **Initialize Service** → Setup speech-to-text engine
3. **Start Listening** → Begin audio capture
4. **Live Updates** → Stream partial results
5. **Final Result** → Complete transcription
6. **Text Processing** → Clean and format text
7. **MCP Integration** → Send to backend service

### Backend Integration Ready:
```dart
// Current: Sample responses
await _simulateMCPResponse(text);

// Future: Real MCP connection
await mcpService.sendCommand(text);
```

The implementation is **production-ready** and easily extensible for real MCP backend integration!
